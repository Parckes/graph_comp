# Network Models Comparative Analysis

This project implements a systematic comparative analysis of Erdos-Renyi (ER) and Barabasi-Albert (BA) network models, generating networks with 1000 nodes, computing structural metrics (degree distribution, clustering coefficient, average path length, and robustness to targeted attacks), and visualizing the results. To run the analysis, install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and execute `python main.py`; results will be saved in the `results/` directory.
